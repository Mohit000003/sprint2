## Introduction
This document provides an overview of **dependency scanning** in GoLang projects. 

---

## What is Dependency Scanning?  
Dependency scanning is the process of analyzing third-party packages to identify:  
- Security vulnerabilities.  
- License compliance issues.  
- Outdated dependencies.  

While it can be automated using specialized tools, developers may need to review results and take necessary actions to ensure security and compliance.


---

## Why is Dependency Scanning Important?
- **Security:** Protects applications from supply chain attacks.  
- **Compliance:** Ensures adherence to licensing terms.  
- **Stability:** Prevents breaking changes from outdated dependencies.  
- **Automation:** Integrates with CI/CD for continuous monitoring.  

---

## Tools for GoLang Dependency Scanning
Several tools are available for scanning GoLang dependencies. Below is a comparison:

| Tool                   | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Trivy**             | A fast security scanner that includes dependency scanning. |
| **Dependabot**        | GitHub-integrated tool for automatic dependency updates and vulnerability detection. |
| **OWASP Dependency Check** | A free and open-source tool that identifies vulnerabilities in dependencies. |

---

## Comparison of Tools

| Feature                | Trivy | Dependabot | OWASP Dependency Check |
|------------------------|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Dependency Scanning** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Automatic Fixes** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **CI/CD Integration** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **License Compliance** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Chosen Tool: OWASP Dependency Check**  
OWASP Dependency Check is chosen due to its **free and open-source nature**, broad language support, and strong vulnerability detection capabilities.

---

## Advantages of Dependency Scanning
- **Early Detection:** Identifies security vulnerabilities before production.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual effort with CI/CD integration.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular scans keep dependencies updated.
- **License Compliance:** Ensures adherence to open-source licenses.

---

## Proof of Concept (POC)
We will implement **OWASP Dependency Check** for scanning GoLang dependencies in a project.

---

## Best Practices

- **Perform regular scans** to identify vulnerabilities early.
- **Use CI/CD integration** to automate dependency scanning in the pipeline.
- **Validate dependency sources** to avoid compromised or malicious packages.
- **Review and audit dependencies** before adding new ones.
- **Monitor security advisories** for any updates related to dependencies.
- **Remove unused dependencies** to reduce security risks.

---

## Recommendations & Conclusion

We recommend using OWASP Dependency Check for GoLang projects because it is free, detects security issues well, and works easily with CI/CD pipelines. Regularly scanning dependencies, reviewing them, and staying updated on security alerts will help keep your project safe and stable.
